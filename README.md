# MediaScores Wordpress Starter Template
A wordpress starter template I created for freelance projects.  This is based off of the underscores starter template. I added build tools like SCSS and Gulp, development frameworks like bootstrap 4 and font awesome.  Gulp will also compile your scss and hot reload.  

You can go ahead and clone this for your own wordpress theme projects.  
  
 Type "Gulp" in the theme directory terminal and that command will start everything.  
 
 Happy Coding!
