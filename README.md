# MediaScores Wordpress Starter Template
A wordpress starter template I created for freelance projects.  This is based off of the underscores starter template. I added build tools like SCSS, Gulp, and npm, development frameworks like bootstrap 4 and font awesome.  Gulp will also compile your scss, hot reload, minify, and package theme for production.  

To get this going for development on your localhost.

Download node.js globally  
Download git globally

Go ahead and clone or download theme to appropriate directory  

Navigate to the appropriate terminal location and do a npm install

Do an npm update in the terminal. This should set everything up.

You can now run "gulp" in the terminal. This will start everything.

Happy Coding!!
